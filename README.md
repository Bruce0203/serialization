## Serialization Considerations

### Why Not Use Serde?
While Rust's `serde` is a powerful framework for serialization and deserialization, it has limitations when it comes to advanced optimizations, such as encoding enum variant indices as varints. For scenarios requiring highly optimized serialization, alternatives like custom serialization logic or lightweight frameworks may be more suitable.

### Experience with Kotlinx.serialization
From practical experience, `kotlinx.serialization` provided better performance and flexibility compared to `serde`, especially for high-performance use cases.

## Conclusion
By rethinking the default assumptions about endianness in network protocols and employing dynamic strategies, significant performance improvements can be achieved. This approach is particularly advantageous in performance-critical applications like game servers, where every nanosecond counts.

By using techniques such as:
- Dynamic endianness negotiation
- Direct memory copying for serialization/deserialization

We can reduce overhead and optimize throughput, ensuring a competitive edge in network performance.
